# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Ensemble Learning

This project classifies brain MRI images into four categories using an **ensemble of deep learning models**: **ANN**, **CNN**, and **EfficientNetB0**. By leveraging the unique strengths of each model, the ensemble approach achieves high accuracy and robustness in predictions.

## üìå Tumor Categories
The classification system distinguishes between the following tumor types:
- üß† **Glioma Tumor** ‚Äì Tumors originating in the glial cells of the brain.
- üß† **Meningioma Tumor** ‚Äì Tumors developing in the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).
- üß† **Pituitary Tumor** ‚Äì Abnormal growths in the pituitary gland.
- ‚úÖ **No Tumor** ‚Äì Healthy brain MRIs without any tumors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Used

### üîπ 1. ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
- Simple dense layers with ReLU activations.
- Input: Flattened MRI image vectors.
- Lightweight and faster.

### üîπ 2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Custom convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction.
- Learns tumor patterns directly from image data.

### üîπ 3. EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)
- Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on MRI dataset.
- Efficient performance with fewer parameters.

### üîπ 4. Ensemble Model (Majority Voting)
- Combines predictions from ANN, CNN, and EfficientNetB0.
- Uses majority voting to decide the final class.
- More robust to overfitting and model-specific errors.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git`

2. **Install dependencies**  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Predict tumor type**  
   `python predict.py --image_path "Testing/no tumor/example.jpg"`
